# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Face Detection and Recognition program that uses the Haar Cascade Algorithm

This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained object detection algorithm called the Haar Cascade, to detect faces in static images. 
Face recognition is performed by training the Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) face recognition algorithm on a custom dataset, to identify and recognise the faces fed into my program.
