# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Face Detection and Recognition program that uses the Haar Cascade Algorithm

This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained object detection algorithm called the Haar Cascade, to detect faces in static images. It achieves face recognition by training the Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) algorithm on a custom dataset, enabling it to identify and recognize faces.
